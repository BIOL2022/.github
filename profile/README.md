## Hi there 👋

<!--

**Here are some ideas to get you started:**

🙋‍♀️ A short introduction - what is your organization all about?
🌈 Contribution guidelines - how can the community get involved?
👩‍💻 Useful resources - where can the community find your docs? Is there anything else the community should know?
🍿 Fun facts - what does your team eat for breakfast?
🧙 Remember, you can do mighty things with the power of [Markdown](https://docs.github.com/github/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax)

This is the Open Educations Resource repository for BIOL2022 Biology Experimental Design and Analysis (BEDA), a second-year undergraduate Unit of Study at the University of Sydney. Open Educational Resources are freely accessible, openly licensed learning, teaching, and research materials. They can be used, adapted, and shared without cost, promoting wider access to educational content.

## Unit Manual

A manual is available for BEDA, currently still under construction. A link will be provided soon.
